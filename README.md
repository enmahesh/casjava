# BPM-CI Project

This guide covers setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI and Apache Ant. We will:

1. Configure a .gitlab-ci.yml file.
2. Set up an Apache Ant build process.
3. Document the pipeline configuration and build process.

### `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
image: frekele/ant

stages:
  - build

variables:
  GIT_STRATEGY: clone

before_script:
  # Ensure Ant is installed
  - apt-get update && apt-get install -y ant

build_project:
  stage: build
  script:
    - ls -la
    - ant compile
    - ant jar
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/*.jar
    expire_in: 1 week

```

### Pipeline Breakdown

- **image**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the CI/CD pipeline. Here, we use `frekele/ant`, which has Apache Ant pre-installed.
- **stages**: Defines the stages of the pipeline. In this case, we have a single stage: `build`.
- **variables**: Defines variables used in the pipeline. `GIT_STRATEGY: clone` ensures the repository is fully cloned instead of being fetched.
- **before_script**: Commands to be run before the main script. Here, we update the package list and install Apache Ant.
- **build_project**: Defines the build job.
    - **stage**: Specifies the stage this job belongs to (`build`).
    - **script**: The commands to run in this job. We list the contents of the directory, compile the project, and create a JAR file using Ant.
    - **artifacts**: Specifies which files to save as artifacts. In this case, we save any JAR files in the `dist` directory and set them to expire in 1 week.

### Running the Pipeline

When changes are pushed to the repository, GitLab CI/CD will automatically run the pipeline defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The pipeline will:

1. Use the `frekele/ant` Docker image.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Update the package list and install Apache Ant.
4. List the directory contents.
5. Compile the project using Ant.
6. Create a JAR file using Ant.
7. Save the JAR file as an artifact.

### Viewing Artifacts

After the pipeline runs successfully, you can download the generated JAR file from the GitLab CI/CD job page.

### Build and Deployment

- **Compile**: Runs the `ant compile` command to compile the source code.
- **Jar**: Runs the `ant jar` command to create a JAR file from the compiled code.

## Project Structure

- **build.xml**: Ant build script.
- **src/**: Source code directory.
- **lib/**: Library directory.
- **dist/**: Directory where the JAR file will be placed after the build.

## Commands

- `ant compile`: Compiles the source code.
- `ant jar`: Creates a JAR file from the compiled code.

## Requirements

- Apache Ant
- GitLab CI/CD

## Setting Up Locally

1. Install Apache Ant.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `ant compile` to compile the source code.
4. Run `ant jar` to create the JAR file.
5. Find the JAR file in the `dist` directory.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline using Apache Ant and GitLab CI. The pipeline compiles the source code and creates a JAR file, which is then saved as an artifact.

---

### Summary

1. Add the `artifacts` section in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
2. Document the CI/CD pipeline configuration and project setup in `README.md`.

Feel free to adjust the documentation as needed to fit your project's specifics.
